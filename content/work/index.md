#Looking for Work

I am currently looking for opportunities as front-end developer and have put down what I am looking for. I guess you can call this a "reverse job posting", in which I intend to outline what I consider a nice place to work.

Please have a look and get in touch with me via email ([hansmann.f@gmail.com](hansmann.f@gmail.com)) if you think I would be a good fit for your organization and vice versa.

## üìÜ When

Soon! I am happy to start conversations and interviews. I am aiming for a start date at the end of the year 2020, possibly earlier.

## üåç Where

I am currently based in Munich, Germany and plan to stay. I am looking for positions that allow me to work flexible location wise. I do enjoy the company in an office but equally value the option to work from home. Given the global health situation, I believe this is relatable. I am also open to work fully-remote.

_Real talk: why are so many companies still requiring people to relocate and force them to go to offices? Make the best of this situation and learn to support remote work!_

## üë®‚Äçüíª About me

Check out my¬†resume¬†and my website for an overview of my experience, education, and more.

I am a front-end web developer specialized in React. My depth in front-end is complemented by non-technical skills that I have gained throughout my career. These help me to multiply my impact through communication, collaboration, and supporting people around me.

Front-end web development excites me because I get to consider a lot of different problems (e.g. design, user experience, performance, accessibility) while working closely with cross-functional teams. Most importantly, I am getting to write code and actually build stuff, which is something I have deeply missed in my old job in finance.

I have an API driven development mindset and really like working with the JAM Stack. I am willing to dive deeper into the stack on the job but front-end is what I enjoy the most.
My focus is on React development in ES6 and Next JS is a framework I love working with, but I am very open to learning and working with other frontend technologies.

## üßê What I&#39;m looking for

The main things I am looking for right now are:

**1. Good people.** The people you work with and the culture of the organization are crucial. Frankly, none of the other things matter without them. I made the mistake to choose companies with toxic cultures in the past but will not sacrifice on this going forward.<br/><br/>
**2. Interesting problems.** I enjoy a challenge, so I can continue to learn and grow. These could be interesting customer needs, technical problems, engineering practices, or some combination thereof.<br/><br/>
**3. Work/life balance.** We are all living in unprecedented times that are putting an additional strain on our lives. I want to work somewhere that is understanding of this and helping employees find a sustainable balance.<br/><br/>
**4. Culture.** I have hinted at this before, but it‚Äôs so important to me that I dedicate a separate section on what I believe is a desirable company culture.<br/><br/>
**5. Communication &amp; collaboration.** People share knowledge openly and take time to explain things. People who just get started don‚Äôt necessarily know less, its that they lack the context.<br/><br/>
**6. Democracy & ownership.** Decisions can be proposed by anyone and are reviewed by the whole company. People are interested not waiting for others to act, and care about the outcome as much as an owner of the company would.<br/> <br/>
**7. Emotional intelligence.**¬†People are encouraged to express emotions in a healthy way at
work and bring empathy to how they interact with others. This is reflected in how people
treat one another. Yelling at others would be a red flag and a cause for concern. <br/> <br/>
**8. Work/life balance.**¬†People work smart at a sustainable pace, so you are successful with focus and alignment. Working on weekends only happens in extreme situations.<br/><br/>
**9. Team size.** I am primarily looking at small and mid-sized start-ups and agencies. Small & mid-sized companies would be ok as well. That said, I&#39;m open to
hearing from you if you think your workplace is an exception that fits what I&#39;m looking for.
